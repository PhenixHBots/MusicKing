# üõ†Ô∏è Setting up the bot
**Note:** This bot is run on your own machine or a server.  
To keep it online, you need to keep the bot process running.

## Prerequisites
1. Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)
2. Install Node.js 14 (LTS)
    * Node.js 15 is not currently officially supported
3. Download the latest bot release [here](https://github.com/PhenixHBots/MusicKing/releases/latest) (click on "Source code (zip)")
4. Extract the downloaded Zip file to a new folder
5 . In the bot's folder (that you extracted from the zip file), open main.js and replace the token.

## Single-server setup
In this setup, music bots require voice channels. I reccomend creating a category for a music text channel and voice channel
*This part is optional.*
